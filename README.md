# Canis Conlang

A detailed documentation written for reference of non native speakers and linguists. In this we'll look at various aspects of the language

## Sounds

### Consonants

|   |  Labial  |Dental|Alveolar|Glottal|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Plosive   |p b   |   |   |   |
|Nasal   |   |   |n   |   |
|Frictive   |f v   |θ ð   |s z   |h   |

### Vowels

|   |Front   |Central   |Back   |
|---|---|---|---|
|High   |i   |   |   |
|High-Mid   |e   |   |   |
|Low-Mid   |ɛ   |   |   |
|low   |æ   |   |   |

## Syllables

### Categories and Basics

Here we analyse how the syllables are formed and give simple examples for the same.

The linguists have divided the consonants into two distinct categories, C and F. The two categories are almost indistinguishable to a layman and doesn't affect the understanding of the context or alter the meaning of the word. The categories were created to account for the high frequency of certain consonants.

1. C: p b f v θ ð h n
2. F: f v θ ð s z

The vowels are unified into a single category, with addition of `s` and `z` sound, to account for the vowelic behavior. The vowel `i` has twice the probability of appearing in a syllable.

1.i e ɛ æ S Z

### Building Syllables

The Canis language builds the syllables according to the following rules:

* (CV)
* (FV)
* (hV) here `h` is the glottal sound
* (CVθ) here `θ` is the Dental Frictive sound

No syllable rules takes precedence over the other in its appearance in a given word. Additionally a word cannot end with `æ`. If the word has `æ` as it's last vowel then extra `z` sound is added to the end

## Basic Syntax Typology

The Canis Language follows a strict word order of SOV which remains constant throughout. Although it is not uncommon for a sentence to miss either kind of words.

### Determiners

Here we discuss about the determiners and where they appear in a standard Canis sentence.

Determiners are special words that gives a noun definition and quantifies it. Canis is a very strict language where quantification is important to avoid confusion.

**Count Determiners**: These determiners come after a noun(either subject or an object)

1. One - niθɛ
2. Two -  biθɛ
3. Three -  hiθɛ
4. Some -  θiθɛ
5. All - viθɛ

**Point Determiners**: These determiners come before a noun(either a subject or an object)

1. These - θæz 
2. That - θisi
3. The - θi (this almost always comes with the determiner `viθɛ`)

**Sample Phrases**

```
1. bɛθəz hiθɛ - Three Birds
2. bɛθəz θiθɛ - Some Birds
3. θi bɛθəz viθɛ - All the Birds
```
