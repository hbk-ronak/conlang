# Syllables

### Building Syllables

Here we analyse how the syllables are formed and give simple examples for the same.

The linguists have divided the consonants into two distinct categories, C and F. The two categories are almost indistinguishable to a layman and doesn't affect the understanding of the context or alter the meaning of the word. The categories were created to account for the high frequency of certain consonants.

1. C: p b f v θ ð h n
2. F: f v θ ð s z

The vowels are unified into a single category, with addition of `s` and `z` sound, to account for the vowelic behavior. The vowel `i` has twice the probability of appearing in a syllable.

1.i e ɛ æ S Z
